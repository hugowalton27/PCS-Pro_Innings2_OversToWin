# PCS-Pro_Innings2_OversToWin
THIS DOES INVOLVE SOME PRIOR KNOWLEDGE

Displays the number of overs to win in a cricket match scored via PCS Pro.

# Instructions:

1. Download the "scoreboard_data-gemini.py" file and remember the directory it is saved to.
2. From the game you would like to score, in PCS Pro, navigate to Tools -> Configuration -> Scoreboard -> Enable Output File 1 with only Capitalise enabled and save it to the same directory as Step 1. This file should be saved as "nvplay-scoreboard1.xml"
3. Run the python file during the second innings and it should display how many overs the batting team will win in.


This file was written using gemini based off of a rough scrap up previously written by me.
